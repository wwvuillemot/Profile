  <h2>Personalizing Discovery @ XboxOne</h2>

  <p class="lead">With an ever-growing catalog of first- and third-party
  sources, how do you blend together both search and browse into a single,
  cohesive experience?  More so, how do you do so across a federated space
  of different services, all while maintaining the flexability for real-time
  changes, even when there are millions of simultaneous users?</p>

  <p>When we said we wanted to personalize XboxOne, we meant much more than
  just allowing our customers the ability to select their favorite color.
  For us, personalization meant giving customers quick access to their
  favorites with deep-linked Pins. It meant solving the cold-start problem
  of an engaging experience from Day Zero. And it meant growing that
  experience by adopting to their implicit preferences and likes over time.
  While XboxOne was inarguably built as a game console, we were
  determined to also make it a multi-media platform.</p>

  <p>As such, when we began to imagine XboxOne, we concentrated our efforts
  on how our customers discover and enjoy content, regardless of whether it
  is a game, a movie, or a song.  Historically, many sites approach the
  problem of a large catalog by slapping on search (aka solve for the
  <i>lean-forward</i> user intent) and calling it a day, letting you find
  the content.  But that is not enough. Some days you do not know what you
  want (aka <i>lean-back</i> user intent) and you want the content to find
  you.  Again, many sites slap on a taxonomy for customers to browse, but
  this can be unwieldly for a large corpus of content types and genres, not
  to mention that <i>how</i> you construct your taxonomy varies by culture.
  Even when using sophisticated browse approaches &mdash; such as
  recommendations or editorial picks &mdash; any single approach cannot
  support every user intent.  Our challenge, then, was to figure out how to
  harmonize multiple <i>discovery vectors</i> into a single, cohesive
  experience.</p>

  <p>Beyond the aforementioned search and browse vectors,  we wanted to
  include a variety of new discovery vectors.  These included editorial
  picks, recommendations, and social suggestions, to name just a few.  We
  knew from experience that each discovery vector worked better for certain
  media-types, and could vary by customer.  We were aware that some
  customers were motivated by top hits, while others would watch a movie a
  friend had watched.  In order for us to truly provide a personalized
  experience, we needed to be able to boost one vector at the expense of
  another based on a customer's behavior. For example, if you tended to
  watch sci-fi movies on Friday nights, we combined this with the fact that
  you converted from a top 10 list better than a recommendation to ensure we
  placed "top 10 sci-fi movies" front and center.</p>

  <p>This is where I entered the picture. During the design of XboxOne, I
  played a key role in promoting this next-level personalization on both the
  services and experiential sides.  I introduced the abstraction of an
  <i>ascriptive spectrum</i> that was necessary to support these different
  discovery vectors. More specifically, we created a syntax that allowed one
  side of the spectrum (perscriptive vectors such as Editorial) to be
  interwoven with the other side (descriptive vectors such as
  Recommendations).  I championed &mdash; and led the team that eventually
  delivered &mdash; the architecture that now powers Xbox Home, Pins, Store,
  and Search.</p>

  <p>As noted previously, the goal that I set for my team was to find a way
  to bring together any number of disparate discovery vectors (<i>e.g.</i>
  search, recommendations, top 10, editorial picks) and mix them together in
  a way that allowed us to change (boost or decrease) a signal based upon
  A/B testing.  An additional goal was to do this entirely from the services
  side, thus obviating the need for an XboxOne flash update whenever we
  wanted to change the console experience, as is still the case with
  Xbox360.</p>

  <p>We achieved these goals to the extent that &mdash; from our customers
  perspective &mdash; it is now perceived as a single unified <i>user
  experience</i>, despite the fact that there are a dozen plus services from
  across the enterprise at work.  And we did so while effectively reducing
  the traditional lead-times measured on Xbox360 from months to what is now
  weeks and even days.</p>

  <h2>Food &amp; Totes @ Amazon</h2>

  <p class="lead">How do you replace the very analog and tactile experience
  of   shopping for food   with a completely digital one?  Can you change
  the <i>end-to-end experience</i> of one of the largest online retailers,
  and in the process, make it feel more like your   best friend   dropped
  off a few items from the store?</p>

  <p>At both <b>AmazonFresh</b> and <b>AmazonTote</b> our goal was to change
  the <i>last-mile experience</i> for our customers. Namely, we believed
  that the experience we provided our customers extended past the website,
  right up to the time their order arrived at their door. In this context,
  Design takes on multiple new dimensions and challenges that are not
  normally encountered with a purely digital experience.</p>

  <p>At <b>AmazonFresh</b>, we were challenged with any number of problems
  on a weekly basis.  From an experiential perspective,   we needed to go
  deep into customer psychology to understand how people approached shopping
  for food, something that is &mdash; for many &mdash; a very personal and
  subjective experience. How do you earn their trust when selecting and
  handling their produce on their behalf?  How do you convey to them package
  size in a way that is intuitive and immediately accessible when every item
  on your website has the same real-estate?  How do you design an experience
  that works equally well for shoppers who walk up and down every aisle to
  find what they need,  as well as for "spear-fisherman" shoppers who know
  exactly what they want?  How do you set expectations and predict inventory
  when much of your perishable goods may go bad?  How do you solve warehouse
  packing problems (for which I received two patents) in a way that both
  reduces warehouse walk-time and increases packing density? As a senior
  engineer on the team, I helped solve these and many other challenges from
  a continuously fed backlog of stories, with responsibilities covering every
  aspect from requirements gathering, to UX design, to test-driven
  development, and even operations.</p>

  <p>At <b>AmazonTote</b>, we again looked to redefine the last-mile
  experience, but this time for the entirety of Amazon.com.  I was in charge
  of a small team, composed of an engineer and a designer, along with an
  external design firm for graphic logo design.  I pulled double-duty;
  during the day I was its product manager, and at night its front-end
  developer.  Together we created &mdash; soup to nuts &mdash; an entirely
  new buying experience for which I am named in four patents.  We launched
  AmazonTote in under ten weeks, which included: 1) design and procurement of
  tote-bags from China; 2) setting up a fulfillment center; 3) complete
  design and implementation of a website experience; and 4) all logistics
  including delivery.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, we designed an <i>end-to-end</i> experience that utilized
  elements of 1-click, but expanded it to include a critical "your tote-bag"
  ordering page where you managed your upcoming delivery. Our primary goal
  was to create a delivery experience that felt more like a friend had
  dropped off a few items on their way back from the store, rather than
  echoing delivery through a national carrier. While the pilot program has
  since moved on to further stages of investigation, the results we
  collected around buying behavior and consumer loyalty to the program
  proved that we had nailed it experientially.</p>

  <h2>Airplanes Over Databases @ Boeing</h2>

  <p class="lead">How do you take thirty years of technology and hundreds of
  databases, and with those provide a <i>user experience</i> that moves
  customers out of the solution-space of command-lines and into the
  intuitive problem-space of airplanes, runways, and weather conditions?</p>

  <p>Imagine over three decades of aerospace engineers creating airplane
  performance databases that span every conceivable airplane and engine
  configuration for a range of flight regimes such as takeoff, landing and
  enroute navigation. Now imagine that each of these databases has minimally
  hundreds, and quite possibly thousands of input variables that you have to
  set correctly in order to perform a calculation.  And then imagine that
  you have to do so by entering them into a <code>text</code> file,
  referencing a separate Word document to learn what each obscure variable
  name means.  And once you have this ready, you have to run it from the
  <code>DOS</code> command-line to get results that you then import into
  Excel to finally begin to do analysis.</p>

  <p>When I arrived at Boeing in 2000, this was considered
  "state-of-the-art" for flight operations engineers at airlines around the
  world who operated our airplanes.  I spent the next five years championing
  an entirely new experience for our customers, finally convincing
  management to let me lead an effort that &mdash; I believe &mdash;
  dramatically improved things for everyone.  Namely, we replaced
  command-line prompts and obscure variable names with immediately
  understandable nouns such as airplanes, engines, airports and atmospheric
  condition.</p>

  <p>To achieve this, we needed to hide away all the details of the
  databases in a way that was scalable for both our customers and our
  database developers. With hundreds of databases and thousands of
  exceptions, it was not practical to hard-wire the exceptions into the
  application, as had been done in the past.  Instead, I designed a
  XML-formmatted DSL (domain-specific language) that allowed the database
  developers to create a <i>self-describing database</i> that not only
  defined all the variables and their legal values, but also all the rules
  that governed these variables. I then implemented the run-time state
  machine that powered the UI from this XML, effectively allowing us to
  generate UI on-the-fly.   As lead developer and designer, I lead the team
  to hide from our customers all the complexities of our previous
  implementations, and in its place let customers focus on the more
  intuitive problem-space where they selected the airplane and engine
  configuration and put it in context to the airport(s) and atmospheric
  condition(s) relevant to the analysis. We even included a complete
  post-computation analysis experience that integrated the power of pivot
  tables and charts so that customers could immediately jump into the heart of
  things once a calculation was complete.</p>

  <p>We were not only successful at the <i>product experience</i> level, but
  we succeed on the process-level, too.  I took a group of six aerospace
  engineers, and I taught them object-oriented programming and agile
  best-practices such as: 1) software version control; 2) test-driven
  development; 3) design patterns such as MVC, pub-sub, flywheel, etc.; 4)
  dependency management and injection; and, 5) continuous integration...all
  of which we accomplished in under two years.</p>
