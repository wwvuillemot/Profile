    As a part of an innovations lab within Azure, we were tasked with using
    =link_to 'hypothesis-driven customer development', 'http://steveblank.com/category/customer-development-manifesto/'
    to uncover new opportunities.  Our ideas did not necessarily need to be the next
    billion-dollar industry, but instead our goal was to reconnect with old and new
    customers alike, and genuinelly understand their problems first.  Then and only
    then were we to determine if we might be able to develop a solution to meet their needs.

    I was on a two-person team with another engineer.  With a boots-on-the-ground
    approach, we began to explore the news industry, but
    quickly pivoted away when we determined that the issues confronting the industry
    were beyond our ability to address.  We shifted to mobile games and consequently
    talked to some 500 individuals in the game industry
    to better understand the problems and issues of free-to-play monetization
    schema.

    We zeroed in on understanding how game developers approach
    engagement post-launch as the area of biggest pain.  In particular, how do game developers
    know if their game is engaging players or not?  Remmeber that there is no revenue at time of first
    play, unlike over-the-counter where revenue is generated upsteam.
    Free-to-play games must engage their players within minutes, and keep them engaged long enough for
    studios to see any revenue, especially since a player's life-time-value (LTV)
    is strongly correlated to length of engagement.

    We acted like a scrappy startup, developing our own brand, logo and product website
    to measure market interest in our hypothesized value propositions.  We used this to feedback
    into our interview questions, continually refining as we went.  We even attend
    the industry's Game Developers Conference (GDC) wearing our own branded t-shirts (icognito to the
    fact we were with Microsoft) to conduct our own in-person interviews and surveys.
