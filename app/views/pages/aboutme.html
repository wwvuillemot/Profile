      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>

      <p>Back in the early 2000s, I did a tour of duty at Boeing as a Japanese
      interpreter of kaizen and Toyota Production Systems.   When I returned to
      software engineering, I took my insights and applied them to the then
      emerging discipline of agile software.  At Boeing, I introduced scrum,
      test-driven development, and continuous integration to my division, and
      then actively evangelized it throughout the enterprise before leaving for
      Amazon.</p>

      <p>Since then, both as software engineer and product manager, I have
      &mdash; from the ground up &mdash; been both creating experiences, and the
      teams and processes that build them.  I am looking for a team that wants,
      and a culture that supports, multi-dimensional contributors such as
      myself.</p>
