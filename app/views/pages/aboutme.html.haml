%h1 Who Am I?

%p
  Back in the early 2000s, I did a tour of duty at Boeing as a Japanese
  interpreter of kaizen and Toyota Production Systems.   When I returned to
  software engineering, I took my insights and applied them to the then
  emerging discipline of agile software.  At Boeing, I introduced scrum,
  test-driven development, and continuous integration to my division, and
  then actively evangelized it throughout the enterprise before leaving for
  Amazon.
%p
  Since then, both as software engineer and product manager, I have
  — from the ground up — been both creating experiences, and the
  teams and processes that build them.  I am looking for a team that wants,
  and a culture that supports, multi-dimensional contributors such as
  myself.
