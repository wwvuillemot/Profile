  %h2 Hi!  I'm Ward.

  %p.lead
    I believe I will make a great addition to your
    team.
  %p.sublead
    I am a bit of a technical mutt, as it were, with
    experiences spanning as an aerospace engineer, technical Japanese
    interpreter of lean practices, software engineer, technical program and product
    manager, and now director of engineering.
  %p.sublead
    I am life-long learner with three advanced degrees in
    engineering; I do not believe in being "a hammer looking for nails," but
    in learning to use the right tools for the job, whatever they may be.
  %p.sublead
    At the heart of it all, I love to create things that
    make a difference.  I am not interested in technical challenges in and
    of themselves.  Such challenges simply offer a means to solve

    %h3 More About Me
    %p
      Starting in my early childhood — painted, as it was, by the
      phosphorescent glow of the television broadcasts of NASA Voyager's
      reaching Jupiter and beyond — I dreamt of orbital mechanics and
      exploring outer-space. After a detour (or three) to Japan, my
      aspirations of a PhD and of working at JPL were replaced with dreams
      of becoming a technical bridge between the US and Japan. It has been
      an interesting journey ever since.
    %p
      At the heart of the many transitions I have made over the years is
      a genuine desire to connect with people through technology, rather
      than to focus solely on technology. Technology matters, but only as
      long as it is helping solve real-world problems.  It is not about
      products or even solutions, it is about the

    %h3 Portfolio
    %p
      My passions are not just centered on the visual aesethic of an
      experience, but are holistic and encompass the entire user flow. I
      believe the real challenge is in taking a complex problem and boiling
      it down to the solution at its most basic and rarefied form: think
      simple, not simplistic.
    %p
      Similar to my passion to bring the best possible experience to my
      customers, I believe the same applies to the team making those
      experiences. It is   about creating processes and infrastructure that
      respect the people using them.  We only have so   much time in our
      day, we need to focus on bringing value to the things we create, not
      just moving around bits.
