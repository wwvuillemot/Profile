  I took over the society's website some three years ago. In that time, I
  worked with the Board to create a visual language, information architecture,
  and overall design for the entire site.  I am responsible for every aspect
  of the site, including a responsively-designed front-end that leverages
  Bootstrap, SASS, and Javascript.  There is extensive administrative features
  both for members to maintain their own information, along with roles-based
  permissions for Board members and site moderators.  The site also integrates
  with Mandrill for all transactional emails, and provides a complete end-to-end
  integration with PayPal to obviate the need for manual processing of checks or
  cash, although these payment means are still available to members.

  Since
  introducing the website, we have seen membership increase year-over-year, much of
  it attributal to a more welcoming online presence that helps drive a sense of
  community amongst our members and the greater communities of Seattle.
