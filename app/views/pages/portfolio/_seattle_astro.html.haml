    I took over the society's website some three years ago. In that time, I
    worked with the Board to create a visual language, information architecture,
    and overall design for the entire site.  I am responsible for every aspect
    of the site, including a responsively-designed front-end that leverages
    Bootstrap, SASS, and Javascript.  There is extensive administrative features
    both for members to maintain their own information, along with roles-based
    permissions for Board members and site moderators.  The site also integrates
    with Mandrill for all transactional emails, and provides a complete end-to-end
    integration with PayPal to obviate the need for manual processing of checks or
    cash, although these payment means are still available to members.

    Since
    introducing the website, we have seen membership increase year-over-year, much of
    it attributal to a more welcoming online presence that helps drive a sense of
    community amongst our members and the greater communities of Seattle.
